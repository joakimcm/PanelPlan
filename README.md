# *Panelplan*
The app Panelplan gives users the possibility to see how much energy they can produce from installing solar panels on their roof. The app also gives information about how much can be saved on the power bill and gives real life examples on what you can do with the given power outcome. 

**The app runs by accessing it through the emulator in Android Studio and press "Run".
You can clone this repository to run it.
We have optimized the code for the device called "Resizable (Experimental) API 34."**

## Functionality 
- Check how much power you can produce by installing solar panels on your roof.
- Get personalized statistics about what that power can be used for.
- Save the solar panels you've created locally on your phone.
- See you house on the map by writing your address.
